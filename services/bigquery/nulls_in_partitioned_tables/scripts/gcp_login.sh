# This script assists in setting up GCP (Google Cloud Platform) configurations
# for a user. Specifically, it checks if the GCP account and project
# environment variables are set, and if not, prompts the user for them.
#
# Once the user provides these values, the script saves them to a .env file
# for persistent storage. The values are then applied using the `gcloud`
# command-line tool to ensure the correct GCP account and project settings
# are active.
#
# It's designed to simplify GCP configuration management and ensure that
# users always have the necessary settings available, making it especially
# beneficial in development or CI/CD environments.
