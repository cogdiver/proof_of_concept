# Exploring Python Imports

## Setup Instructions

Before running any tests or scripts, please follow these setup steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Before you begin, ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

2. **Initialization**: Run the `scripts/setup.sh` script to initialize and connect to the container from where the test commands and functions can be executed.

3. **Documentation**: For detailed information on the proof of concept, its execution, and findings, please consult the documentation provided in the [Analysis of the poc](DOCUMENTATION.md).

4. **Cleaning**: Run the `scripts/cleanup.sh` script to delete volumes and containers instantiated with docker.

Following these steps will ensure you have all necessary configurations and resources to proceed with the testing and exploration of the proof of concept.
