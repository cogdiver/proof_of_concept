# Exploring Python Imports

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a proof of concept project centered around the exploration and management of imports in Python. It delves into the nuances of Python's import system, examining both standard and dynamic importing techniques, and their implications on code efficiency, readability, and maintainability. This project not only demonstrates various importing strategies but also serves as a foundation for those looking to optimize and refine their use of imports in Python programming.


## Practice
```python
pd = __import__('pandas')
pd.__version__

__all__ = ["class1", "class2"]
```
